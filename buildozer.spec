# (str) Application versioning

# (list) Application requirements
# KivyMD has no stable 2.0 release on PyPI (this app relies on 2.0-only
# APIs such as MDButton/MDButtonText), so it's pinned to an exact commit
# via a bare GitHub zip URL (not kivymd==https://... -- that form makes
# p4a write a broken requirements.txt that pip treats as a local path).
# Keep the commit hash in sync with requirements.txt at the repo root.

# (str) Presplash of the application
# TODO(design): add assets/presplash.png (recommended 2048x2048, will be
# letterboxed to fit every device aspect ratio). Build works without it
# -- p4a falls back to a plain white splash -- but this path is where it
# goes once it exists. Keep commented until the file is present; a
# missing path makes packaging crash instead of using the fallback.

# (str) Icon of the application
# TODO(design): add assets/icon.png (512x512 recommended). Build works
# without it -- p4a falls back to the default Kivy icon -- but this path
# is where it goes once it exists. Keep commented until the file is present.

# (list) Permissions
# - READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: the manual backup export/import screen
#   (services/manual_export.py) lets the user pick an arbitrary save/load
#   location via plyer's native file picker. Capped at API 32 -- from
#   API 33 Android splits this into per-media-type permissions.
# - READ_MEDIA_IMAGES: the API 33+ replacement, needed for the file
#   picker to actually see photos when attaching images to a note.
# - POST_NOTIFICATIONS: required on Android 13+ (API 33+) for the
#   reminder notifications sent from services/notification_service.py.
# WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE is deliberately omitted -- it is a no-op from
# Android 11 (API 30) onward under scoped storage.
# Note attachments and the app's own SQLite DB should live under
# App.user_data_dir (private app storage), which needs no permission --
# see the app-side compatibility workstream for that path migration.
