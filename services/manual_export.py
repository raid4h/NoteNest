# Wires Phase 1 (backup_builder) and Phase 2 (restore_engine) up to a
# plain file path the USER chooses themselves, via a native file
# picker -- no Google account, no network, involved at all. This is
# deliberately thin: almost everything it does is already implemented
# by the two services it calls.
